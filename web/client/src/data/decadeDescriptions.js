    <><p>With the American economy recovering from the Depression, a turnaround in the fortunes of the music industry began. The era of <strong>big band swing</strong> had started. Jazz, Latin and Country music were also popular genres in the 1940's. New recording technology allowed artists a more intimate style of singing, giving rise to the <strong>"crooners"</strong>, led by <strong>Bing Crosby</strong>, who held a #1 single for 55 weeks over the decade.
    </p>

    <p>Crooners and vocal pop artists would overcome the big band trend by the end of the decade. <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong>'s entrance as America's first teen idol as well as the plane crash that killed <strong>Glenn Miller</strong> in '44 were both considered significant factors in the transition from big band to crooners and pop.</p>

In the early 50's, pop reigned supreme as artists such as <strong>Nat King Cole</strong>, <strong>Tony Bennet</strong>, and <strong>Patti Page</strong> enjoyed success not only on the radio but even on the television through specials or variety shows.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Rhythm and Blues</strong> of the fifties combined jazz, doo-wop, blues, and gospel to create a unique sound. It also spurred the creation of such genres as Rock 'n' Roll, soul, Motown, and funk music. Meanwhile, <strong>Johnny Cash</strong> and <strong>Hank Williams</strong> led the <strong>country</strong> genre. </p>
    
    <p>Beginning in the middle of the decade, <strong>rock and roll</strong> rose to popularity on the back of <strong>Elvis Presley</strong>, who is widely considered the "King of Rock 'n' Roll". His controversial lyrics and performances scandalized adults but enraptured the younger generation.</p></>,
    $1960: 
    <><p>The 1960's saw a revolution in society as well as music. Traditional rock and roll evolved into more eclectic variants such as <strong>folk pop</strong>, <strong>pop rock</strong>, and <strong>psychedelic rock</strong>. Electronic, experimental, jazz, and contemporary classical music also found popularity in the 60's.
    </p>

    <p>The "British Invasion" began in 1963 with the explosion of <strong>The Beatles</strong> into international popularity that generated a nearly rabid fan following. The success of the Beatles opened up the floodgates for the demand of British music groups across the globe.
    </p>

    <p>The antiestablishment sentiment of the decade found its home in a variety of genres in the 60's, from <strong>Bob Dylan</strong>'s folk to <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong>'s heavy metal</p>

    $1970: <><p>The 70's is most commonly known for the rise of <strong>disco</strong> music from artists like <strong>The Bee Gees</strong>, <strong>ABBA</strong>, and <strong>K.C. and the Sunshine Band</strong>. <strong>Punk rock</strong> rose in popularity starting in the mid-70's and several other subgenres of rock such as <strong>glam rock</strong>, <strong>hard rock</strong>, and <strong>progressive rock</strong> were also big during the decade.</p>

    <p><strong>Hip hop</strong> is considered to have emerged in the 70's, but didn't see widespread popularity until well into the 80's. <strong>Pop</strong>, particularly <strong>synthpop</strong>, was also popular.</p>

    <p>By the end of the decade, people began to view disco music as silly and over-commercialized. Disco's fall from popularity was accompanied by album burnings and "Disco Sucks" T-shirts as the public attempted to purge the genre from the airwaves.</p></>

    ,
    $1980: <><p>As disco fell out of favor, <strong>dance</strong> and <strong>new wave</strong> music emerged in its place. The rise of MTV saw an increase in the importance of image to artists. Along with the increasing income disparity in America in the 80's, it encouraged a focus on fashion and theatrics that gave rise to the modern pop star. Superstars such as <strong>Michael Jackson</strong>, <strong>Madonna</strong>, <strong>Whitney Houston</strong>, and <strong>Prince</strong> became households names not only for their music, but their styles and personalities as well.</p>

    <p>The 80's was also the decade of one-hit wonders, thanks to changes in the music industry and the popularity of MTV. Artists like a-ha (<strong>Take On Me</strong>), Soft Cell (<strong>Tainted Love</strong>), and Dexy's Midnight Runners (<strong>Come On Eileen</strong>) skyrocketed to the top of the charts only to be left in the dust a few weeks later.</p>

    <p><strong>Hip hop</strong> and <strong>rap</strong> broke out of New York's African American communities and into mainstream popularity in the mid 80's. MTV's reluctance to showcase Black artists was eventually overcome by widespread criticism, and Black hop hop artists such as <strong>Run DMC</strong> and <strong>LL Cool J</strong> ushered in the age of rap in America.</p>

Many different genres were popular during the decade, from <strong>alternative</strong> to <strong>techno</strong> and <strong>grunge</strong> to <strong>bubblegum pop</strong>.</p>

    <p>Artists who challenged the status quo were popular among teenagers who sought an outlet for the angst associated with adolescence. Bands like <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> and <strong>Nirvana</strong> introduced the grunge and alternative rock genres that would continue to be popular throughout the decade.</p>

    <p>Some young people sought an alternative to the negativity of these genres, however, which led to the emergence of <strong>happy rock</strong> in late 1995. It also paved the way for bubblegum pop in the late 90's with artists such as <strong>Britney Spears</strong> and <strong>Chrstina Aguilera</strong>.</p>

    <p>Boybands like <strong>The Backstreet Boys</strong>, <strong>98 Degrees,</strong> and <strong>'N Sync</strong> also saw popularity in the late 90's.</p>
